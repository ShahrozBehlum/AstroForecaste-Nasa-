AstroForecaste is a web app (MERN stack) that provides location-based, 6-month ahead weather outlooks by combining NASA’s POWER API dataset . It gives actionable, visual, and probabilistic seasonal forecasts for temperature, precipitation, solar radiation and other meteorological variables — aimed at planners, farmers, and outdoor-event organizers.
